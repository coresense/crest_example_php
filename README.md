This repository contains example code in PHP to work with the CORESense REST API.

There are some examples of generic GET, POST, and PUT requests. The files named `curl_*` use native CURL functionalty with no external dependencies. The files named `guzzle_*` use the Guzzle library via composer. Run `composer install` to install Guzzle.

There are also some Guzzle examples for specific endpoints.

You will need to know your userid, your API key, and your base API URL.
